<h3>Who am I?</h3>
<p>
Matti Vaittinen
<h3>What do I do for living?</h3>
<p>
I am a Linux kernel developer.
<h3>Where am I located?</h3>
<p>
In Oulu, Finland.
<h3>Where am I from?</h3>
<p>
From Finland - but from no particular area. My father's parents came from Karelia - which was occupied by Soviet Union at WWII. My mother's family comes from the Southern Finland. Although ages ago some part of her ancestors moved in Finland from Germany. I was born in Iisalmi (Savo region in Finland) at 1979. At the age of 4 I moved to Enonteki&ouml; - which is pretty much as far north as you can get in Finland. Summers I did spend in mid-finland where my father's relatives moved after the WWII. At the age of 20 I moved to Oulu - but I have never thought I really belong to here. It's my family and work that keep me here now.
<h3>Why does your name sound so familiar to me?</h3>
<p>
Well, I guess you should know that :) It is possible (although unlikely) that you have met someone with exactly same name. I know (thanks to google search) couple of people with the same name. One seems to be doing photography, while other is running a company... So perhaps you have met one of them.
<p>
OTOH, since you're reading a GitHub page you might have seen somehting which is really linked to me. I am pretty active at Linux Kernel development - and you may have seen some emails or patches from me.
<h3>Why there is no resume if you're a kernel developer?</h3>
<p>
Because this is my personal page. And because plenty of my work can be queried from the Linux project git using my family name. I don't think there is anyone else sending patches with same family name.
<h3>Why this page is here then?</h3>
<p>
Not entirely sure. Maybe something grows out of this. Maybe not. How could I know as I am currently just typing the first draft with no solid plan?
<h3>How can I contact you?</h3>
<p>
I could ask a counter-cuestion - why on earth would you like to contact me? I propably won't buy any cool gadgets and I am not going to make deals about transfering $10 Million you have obtained because you're the widow/son/daughter/lawyer of recently passed leader/businessman/sheikh... In case it's something else you may send me an email to mazziesaccount at gmail com.
